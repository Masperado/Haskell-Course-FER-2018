  Welcome to your fourth Haskell training. Get ready to rumble.
  Where will you let recursion lead you?

  You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
  run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-04`, create a Merge Request,
  and assign it to your TA.

  Keep in mind that **all exposed functions must have type signatures** (helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!

  As always, ask your TA if you need any help.

{- * 4.1 Recursive functions -}

-- ** TE 4.1.1
--
-- | Define a recursive function that calculates the minimal number of moves needed to complete a game
-- | of Towers of Hanoi with n disks. 
-- | 
-- | In case you don't know about that game, take a look here: 
-- | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Recursive_solution
--

te411 :: Int -> Int
te411 1 = 1
te411 n = te411 (n-1) + 1 + te411 (n-1)


-- ** TE 4.1.2
--
-- | Define a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two given numbers.
--

te412 :: Int -> Int -> Int
te412 a 0 = a 
te412 a b = te412 b (a `mod` b)


-- ** TE 4.1.3
--
-- | Define a recursive function that returns the last element of a list.
-- | What do you think should happen with an empty list?
--

te413 :: [a] -> a
te413 [] = error "Empty list"
te413 [a] = a
te413 (x:xs) = te413 xs


-- ** TE 4.1.4
--
-- | You have seen a Quick Sort implementation on the lecture. Now is the time to implement Merge Sort.
-- | You are not allowed to use list comprehension here!
--

te414 :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
te414 [] = []
te414 [x] = [x]
te414 xs = merge (te414 $ take (length xs `div` 2) xs) (te414 $ drop (length xs `div` 2) xs)

merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge xs [] = xs
merge [] ys = ys
merge (x:xs) (y:ys) 
         | (x <= y)  = x:(merge xs (y:ys)) 
         | otherwise = y:(merge (x:xs) ys)


-- ** TE 4.1.5 - EXTRA
--
-- | Now you have written 2 different efficient sorting algorithms. Let's write something worse!
-- | Write an Insertion sort function.
-- | List comprehensions are not alowed once again! 
--

te415 :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
te415 [] = []
te415 [x] = [x]
te415 (x:xs) = insert $ te415 xs
    where insert [] = [x]
          insert (y:ys)
              | x < y = x : y : ys
              | otherwise = y : insert ys


  {- * 4.2 Corecursion -}

-- ** TE 4.2.1
--
-- | Write your own definition of the cycle function.
--

te421 :: [a] -> [a]
te421 (x:xs) = x : te421 (xs ++ [x])
